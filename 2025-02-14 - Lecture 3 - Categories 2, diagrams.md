# 2025-02-13 - Lecture 2 (Other categories, diagrams, string diagrams)

## Today's plan

- We will see other examples of categories
- Introduce some sound and complete graphical languages to talk about any category:

# Other examples of categories

Unfortunately, Rust is not expressive enough for us to capture a lot of examples which are standard in math (they would be extremely clunky).
Some examples:

| **Name**     | **Objects**                             | **Arrows**                                                       |

There are also some recipes which, given some data that you can pick, it constructs a new category for you.

- Given a graph, construct the free category.
The idea of "free" in this context is that *there are no other equations other than those necessary to satisfy the category laws.*

# Preorders

We saw that a category with one object is the same thing as a monoid.

What if the *one value* part was on the side of morphisms instead of objects?

## Definition: ???
- *(Objects).* A choice of a Rust type `Obj`
- *(Arrows).* For every value `a:Obj`, `b:Obj`, a Rust type *which MUST have either zero or one elements*
- *(Composition).* For every value `a:Obj`, `b:Obj`, `c:Obj`, a Rust function
```rust
fn compose[a][b][c](a: Arr[a,b], g: Arr[b,c]) -> Arr[a,c] {
    ...
}
```

# Categories where one picks a different notion of equality

Programs under syntactic equivalence, under semantic equivalence.
